# A1-ECE358

- Each command should have a special message. Each message has the format <command>:<source ip>:<port>:<Custom Params>
Since each command has their own handler, you can implement the command however you like. 
- There are many warnings and some bad code in the template. Currently, the only thing our P2P system 
can do is send a message to another peer when they first join
- We will have to refactor some of the error messages, set the ports to 10000-11000, remove warnings.
